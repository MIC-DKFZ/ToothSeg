1) Convert the raw data into nifti and semantic segmentation maps (only applies to our data, we share code for the 
sake of transparency) -> which script?
2) From this converted dataset, filter out all the buggy cases and cases with primary teeth -> script?
3) Proposed method:
   4) Use the scripts in [here](cbctseg/proposed_method/prepare_dataset) to generate the target datasets for the instance and semantic segmentation
   5) ...
   6)
